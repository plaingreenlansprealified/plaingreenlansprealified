Payday alternative loans: Credit unions offer PALs up to $2,000 that you can pay off over a year. Your interest rate won’t be higher than 28%.6 
Credit cards: A credit card may also be an option, especially if you can qualify for one with a 0% APR introductory period. Keep in mind that interest will accrue on your balance once this promotional period ends. 
Nonprofit assistance: There may be community groups or nonprofits in your area that can offer emergency assistance, such as credit or cash advances. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is a government program that provides assistance to families with children. Some employers also offer financial assistance if you’ve hit a rough patch. 
Cash advance app: There are several cash advance apps that will let you borrow money in advance of payday to bridge a gap in funding. Check out the fees before borrowing, though, to ensure the cash advance is worth it.

 Low-income personal loans may be secured or unsecured. Secured personal loans are backed by collateral (like a car or deposit) and may be easier to qualify for than unsecured loans. However, you risk losing your asset if you fall behind on payments.

Unsecured loans donâ€™t require collateral, so the lender more closely examines your income, credit, and debt-to-income ratio when you apply. If the lender decides you have the means to pay back your loan on time and are likely to do so, it will approve the funds.

Sufficient credit score: You’ll generally need fair to good credit to qualify for a personal loan (580–739 in the FICO scoring model).4 Some lenders may accept lower scores, but your interest rates will probably be higher. 
Low debt-to-income ratio: Lenders also want to see how much you’re already paying toward debts each month compared to your income. According to LendingClub, a marketplace that partners with a variety of lenders, most lenders want to see a DTI of 40% or lower.5 
Proof of residence: You’ll likely need to provide documentation of your physical address to show that you live in an area where the lender operates. If you’re borrowing from a credit union, you’ll need to become a member. 
An active bank account: Certain lenders may want to check your bank account balance and activity; you’re also usually required to have an active bank account in your name for depositing the loan funds. If you’re using the loan to consolidate debt, some lenders can send the funds directly to your creditors on your behalf.
